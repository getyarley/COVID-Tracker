Welcome to COVID Chart! I built this app to stay informed on the spread of COVID-19 thoughout the United States. COVID Chart was built on SwiftUI and leverages the new WidgetKit API. The user can filter data by region, state, and data criteria (positive cases, negative cases, deaths, and more). The filtered data is plotted over time and the most recent statistics for the selected region are listed just below. Upon closing the app, the user's filter criteria is saved in UserDefaults, which is then reloaded upon launch to display relevent data for that individual user. 

This app was submitted to the Apple App Store and was rejected because I am not afiliated with a reputable, legal healthcare organization. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend attempting to submit a similar app for release unless you are affiliated with a healthcare organization or government entity. 

## COVID Chart Setup
None required, ready to go out of the box! 

_FYI, iOS 14.0 required._
